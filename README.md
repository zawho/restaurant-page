4/19/23 - Beginning the restaurant page project as a part of The Odin Project's Javascript track. The goal of this project will be to apply what I've learned from recent lessons on webpack and ES6 modules.

4/21/23 - Finished the restaurant page project. I basically just stuck to the point of the exercise - utilizing ES6 modules and webpack - and didn't get too fancy in order to save time and move forward with the curriculum ASAP. I kept the CSS very simple and the vibe a little silly.
